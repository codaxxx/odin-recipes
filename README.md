I brushed up on my HTML skills, especially with lists, headings, links, and images.
Inserting images gave me some difficulty. I had to reference another user's website to gain more understanding.

Things I learned:
"<img src="{location}" alt={"example text"} style="width: 4px; height: 4px;px;">"
- specifying the px dimensions. Especially useful for svg files.

- the noopener noreferrer thing.
